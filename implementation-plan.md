# React Authentication Sample App - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the authentication features of the React Authentication Sample App. The plan is broken down into 10-minute tasks to facilitate efficient progress.

## Phase 1: Setup and Core Components (Approx. 60 minutes)

*   **Task 1 (10 min):** Review `package.json` and ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. Check for any missing dependencies related to authentication (e.g., `axios`, `react-router-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `jwt-decode`, `zod`).
*   **Task 2 (10 min):** Review the project structure described in `readme-md.md` and `architecture-md.md`. Familiarize myself with the location of key components like `AuthContext`, API clients, and UI components.
*   **Task 3 (10 min):** Examine `src/index.tsx` and `src/App.tsx` to understand the application's entry point, routing, and the integration of `AuthProvider` and other providers.
*   **Task 4 (10 min):** Read `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to understand how authentication state is managed, including login, logout, and token handling.
*   **Task 5 (10 min):** Review `src/api/apiClient.ts` and `src/api/authApi.ts` to understand how API requests are made and how authentication-related endpoints are handled.
*   **Task 6 (10 min):** Examine `src/lib/auth/tokenStorage.ts` to understand how tokens are stored and retrieved.

## Phase 2: Implementation Steps (Approx. 120 minutes)

*   **Task 7 (10 min):** Implement the login functionality. This involves creating a login form, handling user input, calling the `login` function from `AuthContext`, and handling the response (success/failure).
*   **Task 8 (10 min):** Implement the logout functionality. This involves calling the `logout` function from `AuthContext` and redirecting the user to the login page.
*   **Task 9 (10 min):** Implement the registration functionality. This involves creating a registration form, handling user input, calling the `register` function from `AuthContext`, and handling the response.
*   **Task 10 (10 min):** Implement the protected routes using the `ProtectedRoute` component. Ensure that unauthorized users are redirected to the login page.
*   **Task 11 (10 min):** Implement token storage and retrieval using `tokenStorage.ts`.
*   **Task 12 (10 min):** Implement token refresh mechanism using `apiClient.ts` and `authApi.ts`.
*   **Task 13 (10 min):** Implement password reset request functionality.
*   **Task 14 (10 min):** Implement password reset confirmation functionality.
*   **Task 15 (10 min):** Implement user profile fetching and display.
*   **Task 16 (10 min):** Implement user profile update functionality.
*   **Task 17 (10 min):** Implement social login (Google/GitHub) functionality.
*   **Task 18 (10 min):** Add error handling and display appropriate error messages to the user.

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (Approx. 60 minutes)

*   **Task 19 (10 min):** Write unit tests for core components like `AuthContext` and API client functions.
*   **Task 20 (10 min):** Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components.
*   **Task 21 (10 min):** Write E2E tests to simulate user flows (login, logout, registration, protected routes).
*   **Task 22 (10 min):** Review and refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
*   **Task 23 (10 min):** Optimize the application's performance by implementing code splitting, memoization, and caching.
*   **Task 24 (10 min):** Review the implementation plan and adjust the tasks as needed.
