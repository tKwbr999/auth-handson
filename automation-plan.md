# Automation Plan for Work Log and GitHub Integration

## Goal

Automate the process of logging work and integrating with GitHub.

## Plan

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The first time the system runs, it will create the `work-log.md` file in the specified GitHub repository if it doesn't already exist.
2.  **Workflow:**
    *   The system will compare the local `work-log.md` file with the version in the GitHub repository.
    *   If there are changes, it will append the commit message and the current date and time to the local `work-log.md` file.
    *   It will generate a commit message based on the changes.
    *   It will then commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository.
3.  **Appending to Work Log:** The system will always append to the `work-log.md` file, never deleting or overwriting existing content.
4.  **GitHub Integration:** The system will use the GitHub MCP server to interact with the repository.

## Demonstration

The core functionality has been demonstrated by adding a test entry and pushing it to the repository.
